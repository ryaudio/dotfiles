# ~/.ssh/rc gets run by the user's shell when an ssh session is made.

# To address the issue where tmux has an out of date value for SSH_AUTH_SOCK,
# we made tmux always use a symlink at ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock for its value
# instead of what SSH normally sets. Therefore, we must ensure that this
# symlink always points to the actual location that SSH_AUTH_SOCK tells us.
# It will only update the symlink if the current symlink is pointing to
# a dead socket. This ensures that connecting with a short lived ssh session
# wont kill the symlink.
# See https://werat.github.io/2017/02/04/tmux-ssh-agent-forwarding.html
